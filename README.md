# Big Data Project on Formula 1

A class project turned into something a lot larger. This repository holds a 2 month long research project trying to understand the correlation between Qualification Times and Final Grid Position in Formula 1. 

## Research Questions

1. I will be examining the changes to the car in order to determine if these changes have a direct impact on faster laptimes the following year. 
2. I will also be using driver performance data to try and predict a drivers final position based on their position in qualifying.

### Dataset - Data Retrieval and Standard Descriptive Analysis

The dataset being used was found on https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017
It contains race entries from 1950 to 2017. 

The dataset includes:

1. Circuits: Description about the location of each track that has been included in the Formula 1 circuit since 1950.
2. Constructor Results: Results based on Constructor (Team)
3. Drivers: Description about every driver that has every raced in the Formula 1 circuit since 1950
4. Driver Standings Driver Standings in each year since 1950
5. Lap Times Laptimes of every driver, from every race
6. Pit Stops Amount of pitstop and the time the pitstop took
7. Qualifying Qualifying position of each racer, from every race
8. Races Each race, at every location, winner, fastest lap, winning team
9. Results Results from each race
10. Seasons Results at the end of each season


### Methods Implemented 
This project contains implementations of scientific methods such as: 
- Data Wrangling
- Data Integration & Data Enrichment
